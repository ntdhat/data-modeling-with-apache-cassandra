## Analytics Database for Sparkify

### Description

The analytics team at Sparkify is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

This project is build for the purpose of creating a new Postgres database dedicated for queries on song play analysis.
